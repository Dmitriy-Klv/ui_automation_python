This project is a robust **UI test automation framework** built with **Python**, 
**Playwright (sync API)**, and **Pytest**, following the **Page Object Model (POM)** architecture. 
It serves as an educational example, practice tool, and portfolio showcase. Tests are executed against 
the public demo site: [https://www.saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com).  


The framework includes:  
- Advanced reporting with **Allure**  
- **CI/CD integration** via GitHub Actions  
- Environment configuration management using **Python-dotenv** and **Pydantic-settings**
- Local development uses `.env` file in the project root for credentials and configuration variables.
- CI/CD pipelines use GitHub Actions secrets (`TEST_USERNAME` and `TEST_PASSWORD`) to securely provide credentials to tests.
- Pydantic `Settings()` automatically reads values from the environment or `.env` file.
## 🔧 Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+  
- Playwright (synchronous API for UI automation)  
- Pytest (with fixtures and plugins)  
- Allure (detailed test reports with history, trends, attachments)  
- Pytest-HTML (basic HTML reports)  
- Python-dotenv & Pydantic-settings (secure and structured configuration management)  
- GitHub Actions (CI/CD with automated test runs and report deployment)

## ▶️ How to Run Tests Locally

### 1️⃣ Create and activate a virtual environment
```bash
python -m venv .venv

# Windows
.venv\Scripts\activate

# macOS/Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
```
### 2️⃣ Install dependencies

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 3️⃣ Install Playwright browsers
```
playwright install
```
### 4️⃣ Run tests
```
# Basic run
pytest

# With Allure results
pytest --alluredir=allure-results

# Serve local Allure report
allure serve allure-results
```

## 🚀 CI/CD and Reporting

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Workflow file: `.github/workflows/allure-report.yml`  
- Triggers: on push or pull request to `main` branch  
- Features: installs dependencies, runs tests with Allure, generates reports, deploys to GitHub Pages  
- View CI runs: **Actions tab** in GitHub  

### Allure Reports
- Detailed reports with history, trends, and attachments  
-  **Latest Report:** [Allure Dashboard](https://Dmitriy-Klv.github.io/ui_automation_python/)
- Latest report deployed automatically after each CI run
